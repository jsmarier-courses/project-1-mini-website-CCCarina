        <h1>Thanksgiving</h1>
        <p>Thanksgiving is an annual national holiday in many western countries like Canada and United States. However, the dates to celebrate Thanksgiving is different in each country. In Canada, Thanksgiving Day is on the second Monday of October; thus, this year’s Thanksgiving was celebrated on October 10. Even though the celebration dates vary in different countries, the meaning of Thanksgiving does not change. People reunite with families or friends, celebrate the harvest of this year, and express gratitude for the past year.</p>

        <h2>My first Thanksgiving in Ottawa</h2>
        <p>As an international student from China, I had not experienced Thanksgiving before. This year, as my first year studying abroad, I was fortunate to receive an invitation from English Corner, a weekly activity for international students to practice English, to join a Thanksgiving dinner at the house of English Corner's organizer Linda.</p>
        <p>The event started a 2:30 on the Saturday of this weekend, two days before the real Thanksgiving Day. Linda’s family members picked people up in front of the Fauteux Hall and drove them to the house. There were about twenty international students in the house, and most of them are graduate students. Linda arranged two wonderful ice-breaking games to let everyone get to know each other.</p>

        <p>After the games, Linda cooked traditional thanksgiving foods for us. Below is a list of food I got </p>
        <ul>
          <li>green beans</li>
          <li>mashed potatoes</li>
          <li>roast turkey</li>
          <li>gravy</li>
          <li>mashed pumpkin</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They are delicious. I am grateful to Linda for providing me with a wonderful experience of Thanksgiving. </p>
        <p>What does "Hello, World!" mean? Here's Wikipedia's answer:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program. It is often the very first program people write when they are new to a language.</blockquote>
